# Graph
A graph is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relationships between objects. It consists of vertices (also called nodes) and edges (also called arcs) that connect pairs of vertices. 
Graphs are widely used in computer science, mathematics, and various fields to represent networks, relationships, and connections.

## DFS
DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
It starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## BFS
BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.f a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
