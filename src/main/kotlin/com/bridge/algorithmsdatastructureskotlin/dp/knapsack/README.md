# Knapsack
The knapsack algorithm is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. The problem can be described as follows:

## Problem Description
You have a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity. 
The objective is to determine the most valuable combination of items to include in the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.
